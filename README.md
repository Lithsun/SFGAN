# SFGAN: Semantic Fusion GAN for semi-supervised learning

Code for paper [**Semantic-Fusion GANs for Semi-Supervised Satellite Image Classification**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8451836/) accepted in the International Conference on Image Processing (**ICIP**) held in *Athens, Greece* in October, 2018.

Code is **available now**.

## Requirements
1. Tensorflow 1.5
2. Python 3.5

## Instructions
1. First download the [EuroSAT](http://madm.dfki.de/files/sentinel/EuroSAT.zip) data set and extract the images.
2. Run the file_reader.m to convert the images into a .mat file. This will be used as input for training the network.
3. Run sfgan_train_eval.py to train the network.

N.B. Python 3 is recommended for running this code as the batching gives errornoues results with lower versions of Python. Haven't tried with other versions of Tensorflow.
